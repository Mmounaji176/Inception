# [mysqld]: This indicates the start of a configuration block for the MySQL server.

# datadir = /var/lib/mysql: This sets the directory where MySQL will store its data files. The data directory typically contains databases, tables, and other data.

# socket = /run/mysqld/mysqld.sock: This specifies the Unix socket file that MySQL will use for local connections. The socket file is a form of inter-process communication used for communication between the MySQL server and client processes on the same machine.

# bind_address=*: This line is specifying that the MySQL server should bind to all available network interfaces. The asterisk (*) is often used as a wildcard to indicate all available interfaces. This means MySQL will be accessible from any network interface on the machine, including external networks if the server allows it.

# port = 3306: This sets the port on which the MySQL server will listen for incoming connections. The default MySQL port is 3306.

# user = mysql: This specifies the user account under which the MySQL server will run. In this case, it's set to the user "mysql."
